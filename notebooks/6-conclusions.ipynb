    "* Probabilistic progamming is extremely useful, our current clustering algorithm (MFM) is a black-box (no one else but the original programmer is able to modify it), furthermore, we have no way of evaluating performance in a probabilistic way since the outout of the algorithm are clustering assignments\n",

    "* The research team is investing a lot of effort in evaluating our current clustering algorithm (people are working on fancy plots) which is taken a lot of time. PPCs seem promising and we it will be great to use them but we first need to disentangle that black-box"
