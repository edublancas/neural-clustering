    "**Grouping** of spikes into clusters based on the **similarity of their shapes.** Given that, each neuron tends to fire spikes of a particular shape, the resulting clusters correspond to the activity of different neurons. The end result of spike sorting is the determination of which spike corresponds to which of these neurons. (Quiroga, 2007)"

Temporal dimensionality is reduced by using an autoencoder (31 to 3 dimensions), for this project we are considering all 7 spatial dimensions (one per channel) in the data, but we are currently working on scaling up clustering by only considering neighboring channels."
